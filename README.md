# nfsw-decrypt
Command line tool for 'decrypting' Need For Speed World communication log files.

Since the game is going to die soon, I thought I might release a little tool that I've written some time ago. It can 'decrypt' some log/settings files that the game uses (NFSWO_COMMUNICATION_LOG.txt and SystemSettings.dat were the ones I've tested) and 'encrypt' them back again, if desired.

If you're the kind of person that likes reading server communication log files, this is for you; if you're somebody who wants a 'private server', this is not the right place.
